Erik Gunderson: TTRPG Toolkit- A toolkit designed for general tabletop roleplaying game usage, allowing GMs to custom define formulas and rulesets while also storing quick and easy character information and stat blocks. Will initially be developed for use with a custom made TTRPG made by a friend, and then extended to more popular systems.

Dan Lowe: IBEIS: an image analysis tool to detect animals in images.

Donald Disha: ESLint: a Javascript linter to check for style consistency between js files. My idea is to add rules and fix current bugs :D

Jonathan Wrona: **Table Tome**

Cameron: My idea is to automate water wheels and remotely control the flow direction of estuaries. Also YACS.

Owen Stenson: Hopefully contribute to some open source project (probably some a linux command-line tool that I use often, such as tmux/livestreamer/znc).

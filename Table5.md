 I am leaning towards creating an open source micro-service data flow visualizer. Small companies can hook in their backend to this tool and it will then allow them to visualize the flow of data in their micro-services. This could be useful for finding bottle necks in the architecture.

I really want to do something with my watch. I have watch face that ive been using for years, but it is black and white. I would really like to add color to the face.

 I want to work with the Amazon Echo and Alexa speech recognition or Raspberry Pi/ PiSoc. At HackRPI I worked on a team that made a skill for the Amazon Echo and Github. The Raspberry Pi has a large open source community that I could contribute to so that would be beneficial.
